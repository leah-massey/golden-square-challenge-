# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._
As a user
So that I can manage my time
I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.

## 2. Design the Method Signature

_Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects._


```ruby
#'reading_time' calculates estimated time needed to read a given text
time_needed = reading_time(text)

text: a string (e.g. "Once upon and time")
word_count: how many words in the text
time_needed: an integer
reading_speed: 0.3 seconds per word

# The method doesn't have any other side effects
```


## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

```ruby

time_needed("Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank") => "4.5 seconds"
time_needed("Alice") => "0.3 seconds"
time_needed("A") => "0.3 seconds"
time_needed("") => "0 seconds"
time_needed(1) => throws an error

```




```ruby
# EXAMPLE

extract_uppercase("hello WORLD") => ["WORLD"]
extract_uppercase("HELLO WORLD") => ["HELLO", "WORLD"]
extract_uppercase("hello world") => []
extract_uppercase("hello WoRLD") => []
extract_uppercase("hello WORLD!") => ["WORLD"]
extract_uppercase("") => []
extract_uppercase(nil) throws an error
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
